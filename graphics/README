The files in this folder are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Use Inkscape
(http://inkscape.org/) to edit or export them to PNG/JPG images.

Some of the SVG files use fonts that are not present on Windows. You can get
them for free from the following links:

Ubuntu: http://code.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Ubuntu&subset=latin
Droid: http://www.droidfonts.com/droidfonts/
Eunjin: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/fonts/ttf-alee (Download the *.tar.gz file)

Linux users can use their package manager to install them. Just search for the
font names.
