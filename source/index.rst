About SETLyze
=========================================

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people involved with the SETL
project (mostly biologists) an easy and fast way of getting useful information from
the data stored in the SETL database. The database was created so certain
analysis could be done which would provide more insight in a set of
biological questions. The application should be capable of giving answer
to those questions by applying specific analysis to the data and
providing the user with an understandable overview of the results.

SETLyze is capable of performing the following analysis:

*Analysis 1 "Spot Preference"*
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL
    plate.

*Analysis 2.1 "Attraction of Species (intra-specific)"*
    Determine if a specie attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.

*Analysis 2.2 "Attraction of Species (inter-specific)"*
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other.

The following analysis will be implemented in the next version:

*Analysis 3 "Relation between Species"*
    Determine if there is a relation between two (groups of) species on
    SETL plates in a location. Plates per location are compared. And
    instead of looking at different plate spots, only the presence or
    absence of a specie on a plate is taken into account.
