This folder is for the third party Windows installers that need to be
incorporated in the Windows installer of SETLyze.

The Windows installer for SETLyze 1.0 incorporates the installer for R version
2.12.1 (`R-2.12.1-win.exe`) which is required for our version of RPy.

Put the required third party installers in this folder before compiling the
NSIS script.
