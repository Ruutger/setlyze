This folder is for the third party Windows installers that need to be
incorporated in the Windows installer of SETLyze.

The Windows installer for SETLyze 0.1 incorporates the installer for R version
2.9.1 ("R-2.9.1-win32.exe") which is required for our version of RPy.

Put the required third party installers in this folder before compiling the
NSIS script.
