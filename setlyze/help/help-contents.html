            <p>
            The <b>locations selection dialog</b> shows a list of all
            SETL localities. This dialog allows you to select locations
            from which you want to select species. The <b>species
            selection dialog</b> which will be displayed after
            clicking the Continue button, will <i>only</i>
            display the species that are recorded in the selected
            locations. Subsequently this means that <i>only</i>
            the SETL records that match both the locations
            and species selection will be used for the analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>Making a selection</h3>
            <p>
            Just click on one of the locations to select it. To
            select multiple locations, hold Ctrl or Shift. To select
            all locations, click on a location and press Ctrl+A.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="species-selection">
            <h2>Species Selection <a class="headerlink" href="#species-selection">&para;</a></h2>
            <p>
            The <b>species selection
            dialog</b> shows a list of all SETL species that
            were found in the selected SETL localities. This dialog
            allows you to select the species to be included in the
            analysis. Only the SETL records that match both the the
            locations and species selection will be used for the analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is possible to select more than one specie (see below).
            Selecting more than one specie means the selected species are
            threated as one specie for the analysis. However, if the
            selected analysis requires two or more separate
            specie(s) selections (i.e. two species are compared), it
            will display the selection dialog multiple times. In
            this case, the header of the selection dialog will say
           "First Selection","Second Selection", etc.
           </p>

            <h3>Making a selection</h3>
            <p>
            Just click on one of the species to select it. To select
            multiple species, hold Ctrl or Shift. To select all species,
            click on a specie and press Ctrl+A.

            The <b>analysis report dialog</b> shows the results for
            the anaylysis. The report is divided into sub elements. Each
            analysis element is described below.

                <h3>Locations and Species Selections <a class="headerlink" href="#report-loc-spe-selections">&para;</a></h3>
                <p>Displays the locations and species selections. If
                multiple selections were made, each element is suffixed by
                a number. For example "Species selection (2)" stands
                for the second species selection.</p>

                <p>
                    Shows the results for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
                    First the records are grouped by positive spots numbers.
                    Then the test is performed on each group. Each row contains
                    the result of one test. Each row contains the following
                    elements:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Positive Spots</dt>
                    <dd>A number representing the number of positive
                    spots. For this test only records matching that
                    number of positive spots (spots on which the selected
                    specie was found) were used. The test is first performed
                    on records with 2 to 24 positive spots. 1 is not excluded
                    because we can't calculate spot distances with just one
                    positive spot. 25 is excluded because the results
                    based on these records will never be significant.
                    A negative number actually means 'up to that number
                    of positive spots excluding 1'</dd>
                    <dt>n (plates)</dt>
                    <dd>The number of plates that match the number of

                    <dt>n (distances)</dt>
                    <dd>The number of spot distances derived from the

                    <dt>Remarks</dt>
                    <dd>A summary of the results. Shows whether the p-value
                    is significant, and if so, decides based on the mean
