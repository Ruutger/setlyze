SETLyze User Manual
=========================================

Welcome to the user manual for SETLyze. This manual is intended for the
end user and explains how to use SETLyze. SETLyze comes with a graphical
user interface (GUI). The GUI consists of dialogs which all have a
specific task. These dialogs will guide you in performing an analysis
on SETL data.

When you start SETLyze, you are first presented with the
:ref:`analysis selection dialog <dialog-analysis-selection>`. This
dialog lists all possible analysis. Clicking on one of the analysis
names shows a brief description of the selected analysis. You can then
start the analysis by clicking on the OK button.

Definition list
###############

Spot
	To analyze SETL plates, pictures of the plates are being taken. The
	pictures are then analyzed on the computer by applying a 5x5 grid to
	the picture. This divides the SETL plate into 25 surface areas. Each
	of the 25 surface areas are called `spots`. Species are scored for
	each of the 25 spots on a SETL plate, and the data is stored in the
	SETL database in the form of records. So each records contains
	data for each spot on a SETL plate.

Positive spot
	Each record in the SETL database contains data for each of the 25
	spots on a SETL plate. The spots are stored as booleans, meaning
	they can have two values; 1 (True) means that the specie was present
	on that spot, 0 (False) means that the species was not present on
	that spot. A spot is `positive` is the value is 1 or True. Each
	record can thus have up to 25 positive spots.

SETLyze dialogs
###############

SETLyze comes with a graphical user interface consisting of separate
dialogs. The key dialogs are described in this section.

.. _dialog-analysis-selection:

Analysis Selection dialog
=========================

The analysis selection dialog presents the user with a list of all
analysis that can be performed on SETL data. The user can select one of
the analysis in the list and click on the OK button to start with the
analysis. Clicking the Quit button will close the application.

This dialog also shows an About button. Clicking this button shows
an About dialog as in most software applications. The About dialog
shows basic information about SETLyze; the version number, the year it
was licensed and by who, a link to the GiMaRIS website, the license
statement, the application developers, and contact information.

.. _dialog-loc-selection:

Locations Selection dialog
==========================

The locations selection dialog shows a list of all SETL localities. This
dialog allows you to select locations from which you want to select
species. The species selection dialog which will be displayed after
clicking the Continue button, will only display the species that are
recorded in the selected locations. Subsequently this means that only
the SETL records that match both the locations and species selection
will be used for the analysis.

The `Change Data Source` button opens the
:ref:`Change Data Source dialog <dialog-change-data-source>`. This button
is only visible upon the first locations selection. After loading new
SETL data using the Change Data Source dialog, the Locations Selection
dialog is automatically updated with the new data.

Making a selection
------------------
Just click on one of the locations to select it. To select multiple
locations, hold Ctrl or Shift. To select all locations, click on a
location and press Ctrl+A.

.. _dialog-spe-selection:

Species Selection dialog
========================
The species selection dialog shows a list of all SETL species that were
found in the selected SETL localities. This dialog allows you to select
the species to be included in the analysis. Only the SETL records that
match both the the locations and species selection will be used for the
analysis.

It is possible to select more than one specie (see below). Selecting
more than one specie means the selected species are threated as one
specie for the analysis. However, if the selected analysis requires two
or more separate specie(s) selections (i.e. two species are compared),
it will display the selection dialog multiple times. In this case, the
header of the selection dialog will say "First Selection","Second
Selection", etc.

Making a selection
------------------
Just click on one of the species to select it. To select multiple
species, hold Ctrl or Shift. To select all species, click on a specie
and press Ctrl+A.

.. _dialog-analysis-report:

Analysis Report dialog
======================

The analysis report dialog shows the results for the anaylysis. The
report is divided into sub elements. Each analysis element is described
below.

Locations and Species Selections
--------------------------------
Displays the locations and species selections. If multiple selections
were made, each element is suffixed by a number. For example "Species
selection (2)" stands for the second species selection.

Spot Distances
--------------
Displays the observed and expected spot distances.

Results for Wilcoxon signed-rank test
-------------------------------------
Shows the results for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. First the records
are grouped by positive spots number. This results in a maximum of 25
groups. Group 1 contains records with just 1 positive spot, group 2
contains records with 2 positive spots, et cetera. However, group 1 and
25 are excluded from the tests. Group 1 is excluded because it is not
possible to calculate spot distances for records with just one positive
spot. Group 25 is excluded because a test on these records will always
result in a p-value of 1. This is because the observed spot distances
will always be the same as the expected distances. The test is also
performed on a group with positive spots number -24. This actually means
'up to that number of positive spots'. So this test is also performed on
records wit up to 24 positive spots. Note that records with 1 positive
spot will still be excluded.

So the test is performed 24 times, and each test result is presented on
a different row. Each row contains the result of the test for a group.
Each result consists of the following elements:

Positive Spots
    A number representing the number of positive spots. For this test
    only records matching that number of positive spots were used.

n (plates)
    The number of plates that match the number of positive spots.

n (distances)
    The number of spot distances derived from the records matching the
    positive spots number.

P-value
    The P-value for the test.

Mean Observed
    The mean of the observed spot distances.

Mean Expected
    The mean of the expected spot distances.

Conf. interval start
    The start of the confidence interval for the test.

Conf. interval end
    The end of the confidence interval for the test.

Remarks
    A summary of the results. Shows whether the p-value is significant,
    and if so, how significant and decides based on the means if the
    species attract or repel.
    Attraction: observed mean < expected mean.
    Repulsion: observed mean > expected mean.
