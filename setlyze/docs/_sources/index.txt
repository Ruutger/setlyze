About SETLyze
=========================================

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people involved with the SETL
project (mostly biologists) an easy and fast way of getting useful information from
the data stored in the SETL database. The database was created so certain
analysis could be done which would provide more insight in a set of
biological questions. The application should be capable of giving answer
to those questions by applying specific analysis to the data and
providing the user with an understandable overview of the results.

The application should be capable of executing three analysis on the SETL
data:

Spot Preference:
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL
    plate.

Attraction of Species (intra-specific):
    Determine if a specie attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.

Attraction of Species (inter-specific):
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other.

Relation between Species:
    Determine if there is a significant difference for the
    presence/absence of two (groups of) species on SETL plates. Plates
    per location are compared. And instead of looking at different plate
    spots, only the presence/absence of a specie on a plate is taken into
    account.
