About SETLyze
=========================================

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people involved with the SETL-project
an easy and fast way of getting useful information from the data stored in the
SETL database. The SETL database at `GiMaRIS <http://www.gimaris.com/>`_ contains data about the settlement
of species in Dutch waters. SETLyze helps provide more insight in a set of
biological questions by analyzing this data. SETLyze is capable of performing
the following set of analyses:

*Analysis 1 "Spot Preference"*
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL
    plate.

*Analysis 2 "Attraction of Species (intra-specific)"*
    Determine if a species attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.

*Analysis 3 "Attraction of Species (inter-specific)"*
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other.

The following analysis will be implemented in the next version:

*Analysis 4 "Relation between Species"*
    Determine if there is a relation between two (groups of) species on
    SETL plates in a location. Plates per location are compared. And
    instead of looking at different plate spots, only the presence or
    absence of a species on a plate is taken into account.
