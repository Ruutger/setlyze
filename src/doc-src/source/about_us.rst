Minor project / internship bioinformatics (Leiden University of Applied
Science) students at GiMaRIS. Developed version 0.2

* Reorganised the Bazaar repositories to be easier to copy, develop and track
* Implemented the cancel button in the progress bar of the analyses
* Implemented the possibility of reading Microsoft Office Excel 97–2004
  workbooks
* Tried to make a start making the technical design match the actual
  implementation…
* Looked into how the repetitions of Wilcoxon tests could be parallelised
  using the multiprocessing module from Python’s standard library
* Looked into how an analysis could be executed serially for all species in
  the database, to find out which species should be investigated more
