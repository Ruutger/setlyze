<h1>SETLyze User Manual<a class="headerlink" href="#setlyze-user-manual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the user manual for SETLyze. This manual explains the usage of
SETLyze.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-setlyze">
<h2>Introduction to SETLyze<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-setlyze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SETLyze is a part of the SETL project, a fouling community study focussing on
marine invasive species. The website describes the SETL project as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Over the last ten years, marine invaders have had a dramatically
increasing impact on temperate water ecosystems around the world.
Substantial ecological and economical damage has been caused by the
introduction of diseases, parasites, predators, invaders outcompeting
native species, and species that are a nuisance for public health,
tourism, aquaculture or in any other way. In the SETL-project
standardized PVC-plates are used to detect these invasive species
and other fouling community organisms. The material and methods of
the SETL-project were developed by the ANEMOON foundation in
cooperation with the Smithsonian Marine Invasions Laboratory of
Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre. In this project 14x14
cm PVC-plates are hung 1 meter below the water surface, and refreshed
and checked for species at least every three months.&#8221; &#8212;
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.anemoon.org/">ANEMOON foundation</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Data collected from these SETL plates are stored in the SETL database. This
database currently contains over 25000 records containing information of over
200 species in different locations throughout the Netherlands. SETLyze is an
application capable of performing a set of analyses on this SETL data. SETLyze
can perform the following analyses:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Spot Preference</em></dt>
<dd>Determine a species&#8217; preference for a specific location on a SETL plate.
Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
<dt><em>Attraction within Species</em></dt>
<dd>Determine if a species attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.
Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
<dt><em>Attraction between Species</em></dt>
<dd>Determine if two different species attract or repel each other. Species
can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, any of the above analyses can be performed in batch mode, meaning
that the analysis is repeated for each species of a species selection. Thus
an analysis can be easily performed on an entire data set without intervention.
Batch mode for analyses are parallelized such that the computing power of a
computer is optimally used.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-collection">
<h3>Data Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#data-collection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First let&#8217;s have a look at how the data for the SETL project is being
collected. When the SETL plates are checked, each plate is first
carefully pulled out of the water and then photographed. This is
done by a standard procedure described on the ANEMOON
foundation&#8217;s website. First an overview photograph is taken of each
plate. Then some more detailed photographs are taken of the species
that grow on each plate. Indivdual plates are recognized by their tags.
The pictures are then carefully analyzed. For each plate the
SETL-monitoring form is filled in. For each species the absence or
presence, abundance and area cover are filled in. For this, a 5x5 grid
is digitally applied over the photograph (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-with-grid"><em>SETL plate with digitally applied grid</em></a>). For
each species the presence or absence on each of the 25 plate surfaces are
filled in and saved to the database.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-plate-with-grid">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/setl_plate_with_grid.png"><img alt="SETL plate with a grid" src="_images/setl_plate_with_grid.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 504.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">SETL plate with digitally applied grid</p>
</div>
<p>Each record in the database contains a species ID, a plate ID, and
the 25 plate surfaces. The species ID links to the species that was found
on the plate. The plate ID links to the plate on which that species was
found. The plate ID is also linked to the location where this plate
was deployed. The 25 plate surfaces (&#8220;spots&#8221;) are stored in each record
as booleans (meaning they can have a value of True or False). The value
1 (True) for a spot means that the species in question was present on
that spot of the plate. The value 0 (False) means that the species
was absent from that spot.</p>
<p>With 25 spots x 2500 records = 625000+ booleans for the presence/absence of
species, automatic methods of analyzing this data are required. Hence SETLyze
was developed, a tool for analyzing the settlement of species on SETL plates.</p>

<h2>Using SETLyze<a class="headerlink" href="#using-setlyze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SETLyze comes with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI consists
of dialogs which all have a specific task. These dialogs will guide
you in performing the set of analyses it provides. Most of SETLyze&#8217;s
dialogs have a Help button which when clicked should point you
to the corresponding dialog description on this page. All dialog
descriptions can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#setlyze-dialogs"><em>SETLyze dialogs</em></a>
section of this manual.</p>
<p>Before SETLyze can perform an analysis it needs access to a data source
containing SETL data. Currently two data sources are supported: Text (<em>.csv)
or Excel (</em>.xls) files exported from the Microsoft Access SETL database. This
means that the user must first export the tables of the SETL database from
Microsoft Access to these files. This would result in four files, one for each
table. The user is then required to load these files into SETLyze. First follow
<a class="reference internal" href="#export-setl-data"><em>the steps to export the SETL data</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can perform an analysis once you have loaded the four data files containing
the SETL data. Start SETLyze and you should be presented with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-analysis-selection"><em>Analysis Selection dialog</em></a>. Select an
analysis and press OK to begin. A new dialog will be displayed, most likely the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-loc-selection"><em>Locations Selection dialog</em></a>.</p>
<p>If this is your first time running SETLyze, the locations selection dialog will
show an empty locations list because no data has been loaded yet. To load SETL
data, click on the <cite>Change Data Source</cite> button to open the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-load-data"><em>change data source dialog</em></a>. This dialog
allows you to load data from CSV or XLS files exported from the Microsoft
Access SETL database.</p>
<p>Once the data has been loaded, the locations selection dialog will
automatically update the list of locations. From here on it&#8217;s just a
matter of following the instruction one the screen. Should you need
more help, scroll down to the <a class="reference internal" href="#setlyze-dialogs"><em>SETLyze dialogs</em></a>
section for a more extensive description of each dialog. The dialog
descriptions are also accessible from SETLyze&#8217;s dialogs itself by
clicking the Help button on a dialog.</p>
<div class="section" id="definition-list">
<h3>Definition List<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This part of the user manual describes some terminology often used
throughout the application and this manual.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Intra-specific</dt>
<dd>Within a single species.</dd>
<dt>Inter-specific</dt>
<dd>Between two different species.</dd>
<dt>Plate area</dt>
<dd>The defined area on a SETL plate. By default the SETL plate is divided in
four plate areas (A, B, C and D). See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-areas-default"><em>Default plate areas</em></a>.
Plate areas can be combined, see <a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-define-plate-areas"><em>Define Plate Areas dialog</em></a>.</dd>
<dt>Positive spot</dt>
<dd>Each record in the SETL database contains data for each of the 25
spots on a SETL plate. The spots are stored as booleans, meaning
they can have two values; 1 (True) means that the species was present
on that spot, 0 (False) means that the species was absent on
that spot. A spot is &#8220;positive&#8221; if the spot value is 1 or True. Each
record can thus have up to 25 positive spots.</dd>
<dt>SETL plate</dt>
<dd>In the SETL project standardized PVC-plates are used to detect invasive
species and other fouling community organisms. In this project 14x14
cm PVC-plates are hung 1 meter below the water surface, and refreshed
and checked for species at least every three months.</dd>
<dt>Spot</dt>
<dd>To analyze SETL plates, photographs of the plates are taken. The
photographs are then analyzed on the computer by applying a 5x5
grid to the photographs. This divides the SETL plate into 25 equal
surface areas (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-with-grid"><em>SETL plate with digitally applied grid</em></a>). Each
of the 25 surface areas are called &#8220;spots&#8221;. Species are scored for
presence/absence for each of the 25 spots on each SETL plate, and the
data is stored in the SETL database in the form of records. So each
SETL record in the database contains presence/absence data of one
species for all 25 spots on a SETL plate.</dd>

<p class="caption">Analysis Selection dialog</p>
</div>
<p>The analysis selection dialog is the first dialog you see when SETLyze
is started. It allows the user to select an analysis to perform on SETL
data. The user can select one of the analyses in the list and click on
the OK button to start the analysis. Clicking the Quit button closes
the application.</p>
<p>After pressing the OK button, two things can happen. If no SETL data was
found on the user&#8217;s computer, SETLyze automatically tries to load SETL
locations and species data from the SETL database server. This requires
a direct connection with the SETL database server. A progress dialog is
shown while the data is being loaded. If connecting to the database server
fails, SETLyze continues without data. Since the database server has not been
implemented yet, no data will be loaded.</p>
<p>If SETL data is found on the user&#8217;s computer, an information dialog is
displayed telling the user that existing data is being loaded.</p>
<p>Clicking the About button shows SETLyze&#8217;s About dialog. The About dialog
shows general information about SETLyze; its version number, license
information, a link to the GiMaRIS website, the application developers,
and contact information.</p>

</div>
<p>The preferences dialog allows you to change SETLyze&#8217;s settings. Settings set
here are saved to a configuration file in the user&#8217;s home directory
(~/.setlyze/setlyze.cfg). The following settings can be changed:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Alpha level (α) for statistical tests</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Sets the alpha level. The alpha level must be a number between 0 and 1.
The default value <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.05</span></tt> means an alpha level of 5%.</p>
<p>This alpha level is translated to a confidence level with the formula
<img class="math" src="_images/math/58a08cb720f6ba6d1fdecfcb3c4f8259ed566bcd.png" alt="conf. level = 1 - \alpha"/>. This confidence level is
used for some statistical tests to calculate the confidence interval. At
this moment this is just the t-test (not used in any analysis at this point).</p>
<p>The alpha level is also used to determine if a P-value returned by
statistical tests is considered significant. The P-value is considered
significant if the P-value is equal or less than the alpha level.</p>
<p class="last">In the summary report for an analysis done in batch mode a result is only
displayed if one of the statistical tests was considered significant. Some
statistical tests are repeated (see next option) and the result for a
repeated test is only considered significant if <img class="math" src="_images/math/bcd49041c2b4d16c7eb882a4055a114ca3566566.png" alt="((1-\alpha)*100)\%"/>
of the repeats resulted in a significant P-value. So with 20 repeats
and <img class="math" src="_images/math/db536bd2df135e525e6e2eae248614de50a75e26.png" alt="\alpha = 0.05"/>, 19 out of 20 repeats (95%) must have had a
significant P-value for the test result to be considered significant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number of repeats for statistical tests</dt>
<dd>Sets the number of repeats to perform on some statistical tests. Some
statistical tests used in SETLyze use expected values that are randomly
generated. This means you can&#8217;t draw a solid conclusion from the result
of just one test. There is a change that the found result was a coincidence.
To account for this, these test are repeated a number of times. The default
value is 20 repeats. This value is very low, but good enough for testing
purposes. When you need to draw solid conclusions, this value needs
to be set to a higher number.</dd>
<dt>Number of concurrent processes for batch mode</dt>
<dd>Batch mode for analyses are parallelized which means that multiple
analyzes can be executed in parallel. The value set here corresponds to the
number of concurrent processes that will execute analyses. The higher
the number, the faster a batch analysis will complete. The number of
processes must be at least 1 and no more than the number of CPUs. The
default value of this option equals to 90% of the available CPUs.</dd>

<p class="caption">Define Plate Areas dialog</p>
</div>
<p>This dialog allows you to define the plate areas for analysis &#8220;Spot
Preference&#8221;. By default, the SETL plate is divided in four plate areas: A, B,
C and D. This dialog allows you to combine these areas by changing the area
definitions. Combining areas means that the combined areas are treated as a
single plate area. One must define at least two plate areas.</p>
<p>The user defined plate areas are only used for the Chi-squared test. In any
case the Wilcoxon test will analyze the plate areas A, B, C, D, A+B, C+D, A+B+C
and B+C+D.</p>
<p>Below is a schematic SETL plate with a grid. By default the plate is
divided in four plate areas (A, B, C and D),</p>

<p class="caption">Default plate areas</p>
</div>
<p>But sometimes it&#8217;s useful to combine plate areas. So if one decides
to combine areas A and B, the selection could be changed as follows,</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/plate_areas_selection_combined1.png"><img alt="Combined plate areas selection" src="_images/plate_areas_selection_combined1.png" style="width: 265.0px; height: 251.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Combined plate areas selection</p>
</div>
<p>And the resulting plate areas definition would look something like this,</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/plate_areas_combined1.png"><img alt="Plate areas A and B combined." src="_images/plate_areas_combined1.png" style="width: 200.0px; height: 200.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Plate areas A and B combined.</p>
</div>
<p>This would result in three plate areas. Analysis &#8220;Spot Preference&#8221; would then
determine if the selected species has a preference for either of the three
plate areas.</p>
<p>The names of the plate areas (area 1, area 2, ...) do not have a
special meaning. It is simply used internally by the application to
distinguish between plate areas. These area names are also used in the
analysis report to distinguish between the plate areas.</p>
<p>The Back button allows you to go back to the previous dialog. This can
be useful when you want to correct a choice you made in a previous
dialog.</p>
<p>The Continue button saves the selection, closes the dialog, and shows the next
dialog.</p>

<div class="section" id="observed-spot-distances-intra">
<h6>Observed spot distances (intra)<a class="headerlink" href="#observed-spot-distances-intra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>All possible distances between the spots on each plate are calculated
using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider the case of species A and the
following plate:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/setl_plate_intra_distances.png"><img alt="Spot distances on SETL plate (intra)" src="_images/setl_plate_intra_distances.png" style="width: 250.0px; height: 250.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Spot distances on SETL plate (intra)</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see from the figure, three positive spots results in three
spot distances (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>). The distance from one spot to the next
by moving horizontally or vertically is defined as 1. The distances from
the figure are calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><img class="math" src="_images/math/5dc66ffd671f86b09107501390c7346f465910a9.png" alt="spot\_distance(a) = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = 3.61"/></div>

</div>
<p>This is done for all possible spot distances on each plate. Note that
there can be no distance 0 (in contrast to inter-specific spot
distances).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="observed-spot-distances-inter">
<h6>Observed spot distances (inter)<a class="headerlink" href="#observed-spot-distances-inter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>First the plate records are collected that contain both of the selected
species. Then all possible spot distances are calculated between the
two species. The following figure shows an example with positive spots
for two species (A and B) and all possible spot distnaces.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-spot-distances-inter">

<p class="caption">Spot distances on SETL plate (inter)</p>
</div>
<p>In the above figure, the distances are calculated the same way as for
analysis &#8220;Attraction within Species&#8221;. Note however that only inter-specific distances are
calculated (distances between two different species). This also makes it
possible to have a distance of 0 as visualized in the next figure.</p>

<div class="section" id="expected-spot-distances">
<h6>Expected spot distances<a class="headerlink" href="#expected-spot-distances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The expected spot distances are calculated by generating a copy of
each plate record matching the species selection. Each copy has the
same number of positive spots as its original, except the positive
spots are placed randomly at the plates. Then the spot distances
are calculated the same way as for the observed spot distances. This
means that the resulting list of expected spot distances has the same
length as the observed spot distances.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon_test">Mann–Whitney U (Wikipedia. 6 December 2010)</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Tests showed that spot distances on a SETL plate are not normally
distributed (see <a class="reference internal" href="testing_optimization.html#testing-spot-distances-normality"><em>Testing spot distances for normal distribution</em></a>), hence the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for unpaired data was chosen to test if observed and expected
spot distances differ significantly. The observed and expected spot distances</p>
<p>Depending on the analysis, the test is performed on different groups of data.
The data can be grouped by plate area (analysis &#8220;Spot Preference&#8221;), the number
of positive spots (analysis &#8220;Attraction within Species&#8221;) or by positive spot
ratios groups (analysis &#8220;Attraction between Species&#8221;). See section <a class="reference internal" href="#record-grouping"><em>record

<p>Each row for the results of the Wicoxon test contains the results of a single
test on a data group. Each row can have the following elements:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Plate Area</dt>
<dd>The plate area of a SETL plate. A SETL plate is divided into four plate
areas: A, B, C, and D (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-areas-default"><em>Default plate areas</em></a>). The test is

4, because area &#8220;A&#8221; consists of four spots. This is done for all records
matching that species and plate area, resulting in a sequence of numbers

<span id="id5"></span><h3>Record Grouping<a class="headerlink" href="#record-grouping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SETLyze performs statistical tests to determine the significance of
results. The key statistical tests used to determine significance are
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Pearson&#8217;s Chi-squared test. The tests
are performed on records data that match the locations and species
selection. It is however not a good idea to just perform the test
on all matching records. For this reason the matching records are first
grouped by a specific property. The tests are then performed on each
group.</p>
<p>Two methods for grouping records have been implemented. One is by positive
spots number, and the other is by positive spots ratio. We&#8217;ll describe
each grouping method below.</p>
<div class="section" id="grouping-by-plate-area">
<span id="record-grouping-plate-area"></span><h4>Grouping by Plate Area<a class="headerlink" href="#grouping-by-plate-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done for analysis &#8220;Spot Preference&#8221;. Each group
is a plate area or a combination of plate areas (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-areas-default"><em>Default plate areas</em></a>). The following groups are defined:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plate area A</li>
<li>Plate area B</li>
<li>Plate area C</li>
<li>Plate area D</li>
<li>Plate area A+B</li>
<li>Plate area B+C</li>
<li>Plate area A+B+C</li>
<li>Plate area B+C+D</li>
</ol>
<p>For each group, the number of positive spots for all plates and that specific
plate area are calculated. These make up the observed values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="record-grouping-by-number-of-positive-spots">
<span id="record-grouping-positive-spots"></span><h4>Record grouping by number of positive spots<a class="headerlink" href="#record-grouping-by-number-of-positive-spots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done in the case of calculated spot distances
for a single species (or multiple species grouped together) on SETL
plates (analysis &#8220;Attraction within Species&#8221;).</p>
<p>A record has a maximum of 25 positive spots, so this results in a
maximum of 25 record groups. Group 1 contains records with just one
positive spot, group 2 contains records with two positive spots, et
cetera. Records of group 1 and 25 are left out however. Group 1 is
skipped because it is not possible to calculate spot distances for
records with just one positive spot. And group 25 is excluded because
a significance test on records of this group will always result in a
p-value of 1. This makes sense, because both the observed and expected
distances are based on records with 25 positive spots, which is a full
SETL plate. As a result, the observed and expected spot distances will
be exactly the same.</p>
<p>The test is also performed on a group with number -24. Of course there
is no such thing as records with minus 24 positive spots. Actually, the
minus sign should be read as &#8220;up to&#8221;. So this test is also performed on
records with up to 24 positive spots. This means that the significance
test will also be performed on records of all groups together. Note
that records of group 1 will still be ignored.</p>
<p>The results of the significance tests are presented in rows. Each row
contains the result of the test for one group. The &#8220;Positive Spots&#8221;
column tells you to which group each result belongs.</p>

<span id="record-grouping-ratio-groups"></span><h4>Record grouping by ratios groups<a class="headerlink" href="#record-grouping-by-ratios-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done in the case of calculated spot distances
between two different (groups of) species (analysis &#8220;Attraction between Species&#8221;).</p>
<p>When dealing with two species, plate records are matched that contain
both species. This means we can get a ratio for the positive spots for
each matching SETL plate record. Consider <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-spot-distances-inter"><em>Spot distances on SETL plate (inter)</em></a>
which visualizes a SETL plate with positive spots of species A and B.
There are two positive spots of one species, and three positive spots of
the other. That makes the ratio for this plate 2:3. The order of the
species doesn&#8217;t matter here, so a ratio A:B is considered the same as
ratio B:A. All records are grouped based on this ratio. We&#8217;ve defined
five ratios groups:</p>

</dl>
<p>You can imagine that the results of the statistical test performed on
records from ratios group 1 has a higher reliability than the results
for ratios group 5. Records from ratios group 1 have fewer positive
spots. Finding that species A is often close to species B on records of
group 5 doesn&#8217;t say much. The high number of positive spots naturally
results in spots sitting close to each other. This is however
not the case for records of group 1, where there is enough space for
the species to sit. Finding them next to each other in group 1
probably means something.</p>
<p>The significance test is also performed on ratios group with number -5.
This group includes ratios from all 5 groups (still excluding ratio
25:25).</p>
<p>The results of the significance tests are presented in rows. Each row
contains the result of the test for one group. The &#8220;Ratios Group&#8221;
