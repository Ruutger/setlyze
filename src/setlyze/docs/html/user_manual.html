<h1>SETLyze User Manual<a class="headerlink" href="#setlyze-user-manual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the user manual for SETLyze. This manual is intended for the
end user and explains how to use SETLyze.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-setlyze">
<h2>Introduction to SETLyze<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-setlyze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SETLyze is a part of the SETL-project, a fouling community study focussing on
marine invasive species. The website describes the SETL-project as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Over the last ten years, marine invaders have had a dramatically
increasing impact on temperate water ecosystems around the world.
Substantial ecological and economical damage has been caused by the
introduction of diseases, parasites, predators, invaders outcompeting
native species, and species that are a nuisance for public health,
tourism, aquaculture or in any other way. In the SETL-project
standardized PVC-plates are used to detect these invasive species
and other fouling community organisms. The material and methods of
the SETL-project were developed by the ANEMOON foundation in
cooperation with the Smithsonian Marine Invasions Laboratory of
Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre. In this project 14x14
cm PVC-plates are hung 1 meter below the water surface, and refreshed
and checked for species at least every three months.&#8221; &#8212;
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.anemoon.org/">ANEMOON foundation</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Data collected from these SETL plates are stored in the SETL database. This
database currently contains over 25000 records containing information of over
200 species in different localities throughout the Netherlands. SETLyze is an
application capable of performing a set of analyses on this SETL data. SETLyze
is capable of performing the following analyses:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Analysis 1 &#8220;Spot Preference&#8221;</em></dt>
<dd>Determine a species’ preference for a specific location on a SETL plate.
Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
<dt><em>Analysis 2 &#8220;Attraction within Species&#8221;</em></dt>
<dd>Determine if a species attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.
Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
<dt><em>Analysis 3 &#8220;Attraction between Species&#8221;</em></dt>
<dd>Determine if two different species attract or repel each other. Species
can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following analysis will be implemented in the next version:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Analysis 4 &#8220;Relation between Species&#8221;</em></dt>
<dd>Determine if there is a relation between the presence/absence of two
species in a specific location. Plates per location are compared. Also
instead of looking at different plate surfaces, only the presence or
absence of a species on a plate is taken into account.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="data-collection">
<h3>Data Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#data-collection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First let&#8217;s have a look at how the data for the SETL-project is being
collected. When the SETL plates are checked, each plate is first
carefully pulled out of the water and then photographed. This is
done by a standard procedure described on the ANEMOON
foundation&#8217;s website. First an overview photograph is taken of each
plate. Then some more detailed photographs are taken of the species
that grow on each plate. Indivdual plates are recognized by their tags.
The pictures are then carefully analyzed. For each plate the
SETL-monitoring form is filled in. For each species the absence or
presence, abundance and area cover are filled in. For this, a 5x5 grid
is digitally applied over the photograph. For each species the presence
or absence on each of the 25 plate surfaces are filled in and saved
to the database.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-plate-with-grid">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/setl_plate_with_grid.png"><img alt="SETL plate with a grid" src="_images/setl_plate_with_grid.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 504.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 1. SETL-plate with digitally applied grid</p>
</div>
<p>Each record in the database contains a species ID, a plate ID, and
the 25 plate surfaces. The species ID links to the species that was found
on the plate. The plate ID links to the plate on which that species was
found. The plate ID is also linked to the location where this plate
was deployed. The 25 plate surfaces (&#8220;spots&#8221;) are stored in each record
as booleans (meaning they can have a value of True or False). The value
1 (True) for a spot means that the species in question was present on
that spot of the plate. The value 0 (False) means that the species
was absent from that spot.</p>
<p>With 25 spots x 2500 records = 625000+ booleans for the presence/absence of species,
automatic methods of analyzing this data are required. Hence SETLyze
was developed, a tool for analyzing the settlement of species
on SETL plates.</p>

<h2>Using SETLyze<a class="headerlink" href="#using-setlyze" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SETLyze comes with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI consists
of dialogs which all have a specific task. These dialogs will guide
you in performing the set of analyses it provides. Most of SETLyze&#8217;s
dialogs have a Help button. Clicking this Help button should point you
to the corresponding dialog description on this page. All dialog
descriptions can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#setlyze-dialogs"><em>SETLyze dialogs</em></a>
section of this manual.</p>
<p>Before SETLyze can perform an analysis, it needs access to a data
source containing SETL data. Currently just one data source is
supported: manually exported CSV files from the Microsoft Access SETL
database. This means that the user must first export the tables of the
SETL database from Microsoft Access to CSV files. This would result in
four CSV files, one for each table. The user is then required to load
these files into SETLyze. First follow <a class="reference internal" href="#export-csv-msaccess"><em>the steps to export the
SETL data to CSV files</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can perform an analysis once you have the four CSV files containing
the SETL data. First run SETLyze by (double) clicking the file named
&#8220;setlyze.pyw&#8221;. You should be presented with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-analysis-selection"><em>analysis selection dialog</em></a>. Select
the analysis you want to perform and press OK to begin. A new dialog
will be displayed, most likely the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-loc-selection"><em>locations selection dialog</em></a>.</p>
<p>If this is your first time running SETLyze, the locations selection
dialog will show an empty locations list. The list is empty because the
data source has not been set yet. To set the data source and load the
SETL data, click on the <cite>Change Data Source</cite> button to open the
<a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-change-data-source"><em>change data source dialog</em></a>. This
dialog allows you to load the data from the CSV files you&#8217;ve just
created.</p>
<p>Once the data has been loaded, the locations selection dialog will
automatically update the list of locations. From here on it&#8217;s just a
matter of following the instruction one the dialogs. Should you need
more help, scroll down to the <a class="reference internal" href="#setlyze-dialogs"><em>SETLyze dialogs</em></a>
section for a more extensive description of each dialog. The dialog
descriptions are also accessible from SETLyze&#8217;s dialogs itself by
clicking the Help button on a dialog.</p>
<div class="section" id="definition-list">
<h3>Definition List<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This part of the user manual describes some terminology often used
throughout the application and this manual.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Intra-specific</dt>
<dd>Within a single species.</dd>
<dt>Inter-specific</dt>
<dd>Between two different species.</dd>
<dt>Plate area</dt>
<dd>The defined area on a SETL-plate. By default the SETL-plate is divided in
four plate areas (A, B, C and D). See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-areas-default"><em>figure 7</em></a>.
Plate areas can be combined, see <a class="reference internal" href="#dialog-define-plate-areas"><em>Define Plate Areas dialog</em></a>.</dd>
<dt>Positive spot</dt>
<dd>Each record in the SETL database contains data for each of the 25
spots on a SETL plate. The spots are stored as booleans, meaning
they can have two values; 1 (True) means that the species was present
on that spot, 0 (False) means that the species was absent on
that spot. A spot is &#8220;positive&#8221; if the spot value is 1 or True. Each
record can thus have up to 25 positive spots.</dd>
<dt>SETL-plate</dt>
<dd>In the SETL-project standardized PVC-plates are used to detect invasive
species and other fouling community organisms. In this project 14x14
cm PVC-plates are hung 1 meter below the water surface, and refreshed
and checked for species at least every three months.</dd>
<dt>Spot</dt>
<dd>To analyze SETL plates, photographs of the plates are taken. The
photographs are then analyzed on the computer by applying a 5x5
grid to the photographs. This divides the SETL plate into 25 equal
surface areas (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-with-grid"><em>figure 1</em></a>). Each
of the 25 surface areas are called &#8220;spots&#8221;. Species are scored for
presence/absence for each of the 25 spots on each SETL plate, and the
data is stored in the SETL database in the form of records. So each
SETL record in the database contains presence/absence data of one
species for all 25 spots on a SETL plate.</dd>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. Analysis Selection dialog</p>
</div>
<p>The analysis selection dialog is the first dialog you see when SETLyze
is started. It allows the user to select an analysis to perform on SETL
data. The user can select one of the analyses in the list and click on
the OK button to start the analysis. Clicking the Quit button closes
the application.</p>
<p>After pressing the OK button, two things can happen. If no SETL data was
found on the user&#8217;s computer, SETLyze automatically tries to load SETL
localities and species data from the remote SETL database. This requires
a direct connection with the SETL database server. A progress dialog is
shown while the data is being loaded. If connecting to the remote
database fails, SETLyze continues without data.</p>
<p>If SETL data is found on the user&#8217;s computer, a message dialog is shown
presenting the user with two options. Option one is to use the SETL data
that was previously saved to the user&#8217;s computer. Option two is to
discard the saved data and load data from the remote SETL database.</p>
<p>Clicking the About button shows SETLyze&#8217;s About dialog. The About dialog
shows basic information about SETLyze; its version number, license
information, a link to the GiMaRIS website, the application developers,
and contact information.</p>

<p>The preferences dialog allows you to change SETLyze&#8217;s settings. At this point
there are just just two settings you can change. These are described below.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Alpha level (α) for statistical tests</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Sets the alpha level. The alpha level must be a number between 0 and 1.
The default value <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.05</span></tt> means an alpha level of 5%.</p>
<p class="last">This alpha level is translated to a confidence level with the formula
<span class="math">conf. level = 1 - \alpha</span>. This confidence level is
used for some statistical tests to calculate the confidence interval. At
this moment this is just the t-test (not used in any analysis at this point).
The alpha level is also used to determine if a specific P-value returned by
statistical tests is considered significant. If P-value &lt; alpha level,
then the P-value is considered significant. P-values &gt;= alpha level are
considered non-significant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number of repeats for statistical tests</dt>
<dd>Sets the number of repeats to perform on some statistical tests. Some
statistical tests used in SETLyze use expected values that are randomly
generated. This means you can&#8217;t draw a solid conclusion from the result
of just one test. There is a change that the found result was a coincidence.
To account for this, these test are repeated a number of times. The default
value is 10 repeats. This value is very low, but good enough for
testing purposes. Once you need results to make a solid conclusion,
set this to a higher number. Note that analyses will run much longer with
many repeats (and an Abort button is not yet implemented).</dd>

<p>But sometimes it&#8217;s useful to combine plate areas. So if the user decides
to combine area A and B, the areas selection would be set like this,</p>

<p>And the resulting plate areas definition would look something like this,</p>

<p>This would result in three plate areas. Analysis 1 would then determine
if the selected species has a preference for either of the three plate
areas.</p>
<p>The names of the plate areas (area 1, area 2, ...) do not have a
special meaning. It is simply used internally by the application to
distinguish between plate areas. These area names are also used in the
analysis report to distinguish between the plate areas.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 11. Spot distances on SETL plate (intra)</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see from the figure, three positive spots results in three
spot distances (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>). The distance from one spot to the next
by moving horizontally or vertically is defined as 1. The distances from
the figure are calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math">spot\_distance(a) = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = 3.61</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math">spot\_distance(b) = \sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = 3.16</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math">spot\_distance(c) = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3</span></div>

<h5>Observed spot distances (inter)<a class="headerlink" href="#observed-spot-distances-inter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>First the plate records are collected that contain both of the selected

two species. The following figure shows an example with positive spots
for two species (A and B) and all possible spot distnaces.</p>

same number of positive spots as its original, except the positive
spots are placed randomly at the plates. Then the spot distances
are calculated the same way as for the observed spot distances. This
means that the resulting list of expected spot distances has the same

<p>Tests showed that spot distances on a SETL plate are not normally
distributed (see <a class="reference internal" href="testing_optimization.html#testing-spot-distances-normality"><em>Testing spot distances for normal distribution</em></a>), hence the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for unpaired data was chosen to test if observed and expected
spot distances differ significantly. The observed and expected spot distances</p>
<p>Depending on the analysis, the test is performed on different groups of data.
The data can be grouped by plate area (analysis 1), the number of positive spots

<p>SETLyze performs statistical tests to determine the significance of
results. The key statistical tests used to determine significance are
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Pearson&#8217;s Chi-squared test. The tests
are performed on records data that match the locations and species
selection. It is however not a good idea to just perform the test
on all matching records. For this reason the matching records are first
grouped by a specific property. The tests are then performed on each
group.</p>
<p>Two methods for grouping records have been implemented. One is by positive
spots number, and the other is by positive spots ratio. We&#8217;ll describe
each grouping method below.</p>
<div class="section" id="grouping-by-plate-area">
<h4>Grouping by Plate Area<a class="headerlink" href="#grouping-by-plate-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done for analysis 1, &#8220;spot preference&#8221;. Each group
is a plate area or a combination of plate areas (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-plate-areas-default"><em>figure 7</em></a>). The following groups are defined:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plate area A</li>
<li>Plate area B</li>
<li>Plate area C</li>
<li>Plate area D</li>
<li>Plate area A+B</li>
<li>Plate area B+C</li>
<li>Plate area A+B+C</li>
<li>Plate area B+C+D</li>
</ol>
<p>For each group, the number of positive spots for all plates and that specific
plate area are calculated. These make up the observed values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="record-grouping-by-number-of-positive-spots">
<h4>Record grouping by number of positive spots<a class="headerlink" href="#record-grouping-by-number-of-positive-spots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done in the case of calculated spot distances
for a single species (or multiple species grouped together) on SETL
plates (analysis 2).</p>
<p>A record has a maximum of 25 positive spots, so this results in a
maximum of 25 record groups. Group 1 contains records with just one
positive spot, group 2 contains records with two positive spots, et
cetera. Records of group 1 and 25 are left out however. Group 1 is
skipped because it is not possible to calculate spot distances for
records with just one positive spot. And group 25 is excluded because
a significance test on records of this group will always result in a
p-value of 1. This makes sense, because both the observed and expected
distances are based on records with 25 positive spots, which is a full
SETL-plate. As a result, the observed and expected spot distances will
be exactly the same.</p>
<p>The test is also performed on a group with number -24. Of course there
is no such thing as records with minus 24 positive spots. Actually, the
minus sign should be read as &#8220;up to&#8221;. So this test is also performed on
records with up to 24 positive spots. This means that the significance
test will also be performed on records of all groups together. Note
that records of group 1 will still be ignored.</p>
<p>The results of the significance tests are presented in rows. Each row
contains the result of the test for one group. The &#8220;Positive Spots&#8221;
column tells you to which group each result belongs.</p>

<div class="section" id="record-grouping-by-ratios-groups">
<h4>Record grouping by ratios groups<a class="headerlink" href="#record-grouping-by-ratios-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This type of grouping is done in the case of calculated spot distances
between two different (groups of) species (analysis 3).</p>
<p>When dealing with two species, plate records are matched that contain
both species. This means we can get a ratio for the positive spots for
each matching SETL plate record. Consider <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-spot-distances-inter"><em>figure 12</em></a>
which visualizes a SETL plate with positive spots of species A and B.
There are two positive spots of one species, and three positive spots of
the other. That makes the ratio for this plate 2:3. The order of the
species doesn&#8217;t matter here, so a ratio A:B is considered the same as
ratio B:A. All records are grouped based on this ratio. We&#8217;ve defined
five ratios groups:</p>

<p class="last">Ratio 25:25 is removed from this group because the p-value for
records with that ratio would always be 1.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can imagine that the results of the statistical test performed on
records from ratios group 1 has a higher reliability than the results
for ratios group 5. Records from ratios group 1 have fewer positive
spots. Finding that species A is often close to species B on records of
group 5 doesn&#8217;t say much. The high number of positive spots naturally
results in spots sitting close to each other. This is however
not the case for records of group 1, where there is enough space for
the species to sit. Finding them next to each other in group 1
probably means something.</p>
<p>The significance test is also performed on ratios group with number -5.
This group includes ratios from all 5 groups (still excluding ratio
25:25).</p>
<p>The results of the significance tests are presented in rows. Each row
contains the result of the test for one group. The &#8220;Ratios Group&#8221;
column tells you to which group each result belongs.</p>

<p>This section describes how to export the SETL data from the Microsoft
Access database to CSV files.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open the SETL database file (*.mdb) in Microsoft Access. You&#8217;ll
see four tables in the left column: SETL_localities, SETL_plates,
SETL_records and SETL_species.</li>
<li>To export a table, right-click on it to open the drop menu. From the
menu select Export &gt; Text file. Then give the filename of the output
file. Make sure to include the table name in the filename (e.g.
setl_localities.csv for the &#8220;SETL_localities&#8221; table). Uncheck all
other options and press OK.</li>
<li>In the next dialog that appears select the option that separates
fields with a character. The separator character must be a semicolon
(&#8221;;&#8221;). If it&#8217;s not, change it by clicking the Advanced button. Then
click Finish to export the data to a CSV file.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all tables.</li>
<li>You should end up with four files, one CSV file for each table. Put
these files in one folder.</li>
