Introduction to SETLyze
===================================

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people (mostly biologists) involved
with the SETL project an easy and fast way of getting useful information from
the data stored in the SETL database. The database was created so certain
analysis could be done which would provide more insight in a set of
biological questions. The application should be capable of giving answer
to those questions by applying specific analysis to the data, and
providing the user with an understandable overview of the results.

The application is currently capable of executing four analysis on the
SETL data:

Spot Preference:
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL
    plate.

Attraction of Species (intra-specific):
    Determine if a specie attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.

Attraction of Species (inter-specific):
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other.

Relation between Species:
    Determine if there is correlation for the presence or absence of two
    (groups of) species on SETL plates. Plates per location are compared.
    And instead of looking at different plate spots, only the
    presence/absence of a specie on a plate is taken into account.
