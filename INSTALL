Requirements
############

Because SETLyze is written in the Python programming language, it has
a fair amount of requirements. These requirements need
to be satisfied for SETLyze to run on your system. The exact
requirements are described below.

System Requirements
===================

* Operating System: Microsoft® Windows®, GNU/Linux
* Disk space: 2 MB (excl. dependencies), 70+ MB (incl. dependencies)


Dependencies
============

* Python 2.6
* GTK+ 2
* R (v2.9.1 on Windows)
* setuptools for Python 2.6
* PyGTK for Python 2.6
* PyCairo for Python 2.6
* PyGObject for Python 2.6
* RPy 1 for Python 2.6
* Python Win32 Extensions for Python 2.6 (Windows only)

Installation
############

Microsoft® Windows®
===================

For Windows® users, an installer is available that includes the SETLyze
core package together with the necessary pre-requisites. The installer
takes care of installing all dependencies so the user does not have to
worry about this.

GNU/Linux
=========

For GNU/Linux users, a source package is available. The source package
doesn't contain the dependencies. GNU/Linux user can use their
package manager to install the dependencies.

On Ubuntu or other Debian derivatives, installing the dependencies
can be done with the following command: ::

    sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-rpy python-setuptools

Answer "yes" when asked to install the dependencies as well. Once all
dependencies are installed, you can start SETLyze by running
"setlyze.pyw" from the extracted archive.

If you want to install SETLyze system wide, you can do so with the
provided setup script. The following command will install
SETLyze's modules to an existing Python installation and copies
SETLyze's executable "setlyze.pyw" to the system's "bin" folder. ::

    sudo python setup.py install

Once installed, SETLyze can be started from the command-line with, ::

    setlyze.pyw
