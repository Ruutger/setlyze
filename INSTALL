Linux Installation Instructions for SETLyze
===========================================

Required Packages
=================

SETLyze depends on the following packages and they need to be installed in
order to run SETLyze.

* python (>=2.6 & <3.0)
* libgtk2.0-0
* r-base-core
* python-gtk2
* python-cairo
* python-gobject
* python-rpy

On Ubuntu or other Debian derivatives, installing the dependencies can be done
with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-rpy


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) First make sure you have all dependencies installed (see above).

The 'cmake' package is required to configure and build SETLyze from source. Make
sure it's installed befor continuing with the next step.

    sudo apt-get install cmake


2) Configuring the SETLyze build

In the top level directory from where you extracted setlyze, run the following
commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    ccmake ..

This will present you with a simple console based GUI of options for SETLyze.
First press 'c' to run the configure script. Review the options and change what
you think is necessary. It is recommended to set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to '/usr'
instead of '/usr/local'. Again press 'c' to run the configure script. Then
press 'g' to generate the make files and exit.


3) Compiling and installing

As usual, type:

    make

followed by (as root):

    make install


Uninstallation Instructions
===========================

Removing all installed setlyze files
------------------------------------

Change to the build folder which you created in the top level directory
from where you extracted SETLyze:

    cd build/

And run the uninstall command as root:

    make uninstall


Alternative uninstallation
--------------------------

Alternatively, you can remove the files listed in the install_manifest.txt file
which has the same result as the 'make uninstall' command.

    xargs -d "\n" rm < install_manifest.txt
