Linux Installation Instructions for SETLyze
===========================================

Required Packages
=================

SETLyze depends on the following packages and they need to be installed in
order to run SETLyze.

* python (>=2.6 & <3.0)
* libgtk2.0-0
* r-base-core
* python-gtk2

On Debian or derivatives, installing the dependencies can be done with the
following command:

    sudo apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-rpy python-xlrd


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) First make sure you have all dependencies installed (see above).

The 'cmake' and 'cmake-curses-gui' packages are required to configure and
install SETLyze from source. Make sure they are installed before continuing
with the next step.

    sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui

2) Configuring the SETLyze build

In the top level directory from where you extracted setlyze, run the following
commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    ccmake ..

This will present you with a simple console based GUI of options for installing
SETLyze. First press 'c' to run the configure script. Review the options and
change options where necessary (usually `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` should be set
to `/usr`). Again press 'c' to confirm the options. Then press 'g' to generate
the make files and exit.

3) Installing

Run the following command (as root) to install SETLyze:

    make install

with the command `setlyze`.
