About SETLyze
=============

The purpose of SETLyze is to provide the people involved with the SETL-project
an easy and fast way of getting useful information from the data stored in the
SETL database. The SETL database at GiMaRIS contains data about the settlement
of species in Dutch waters. SETLyze helps provide more insight in a set of
biological questions by analyzing this data. SETLyze is capable of performing
the following set of analyses:

*Analysis 1 "Spot Preference"*
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL plate.
    Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.

*Analysis 2 "Attraction of Species (intra-specific)"*
    Determine if a species attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.
    Species can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.

*Analysis 3 "Attraction of Species (inter-specific)"*
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other. Species
    can be combined so that they are treated as a single species.

The following analysis will be implemented in the next version:

*Analysis 4 "Relation between Species"*
    Determine if there is a relation between two species on SETL-plates in a
    specific location. Plates per location are compared. Also instead of
    looking at different plate surfaces, only the presence or absence of a
    species on a plate is taken into account.
