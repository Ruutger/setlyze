SETLyze is an application which is capable of performing
a set of analysis on the data from the SETL database. SETLyze is
capable of performing the following analysis:

*Analysis 1 "Spot Preference"*
    Determine a speciesâ€™ preference for a specific location on a SETL
    plate.

*Analysis 2.1 "Attraction of Species (intra-specific)"*
    Determine if a specie attracts or repels individuals of its own kind.

*Analysis 2.2 "Attraction of Species (inter-specific)"*
    Determine if two different species attract or repel each other.

The following analysis will be implemented in the next version:

*Analysis 3 "Relation between Species"*
    Determine if there is a relation between two (groups of) species on
    SETL plates in a location. Plates per location are compared. Also
    instead of looking at different plate spots, only the presence or
    absence of a specie on a plate is taken into account.
